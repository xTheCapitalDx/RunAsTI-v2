  RunAsTI v2


-Based on AveYo's proven RunAsTI scripts.
-Enhanced with new features and support for additional file types.
-Maintains the core PowerShell implementation from AveYo's iterations - it works well and is very effective.
-This is the DEFINITIVE version of this utility - this is the one you SHOULD be using! Other versions are less refined.
-AV's such as Windows Defender may or may not flag this utility, in which case it is a false positive. RunAsTI v2 does not do anything harmful - it contains obfuscated code to evade detection so that it can successfully grant trustedinstaller privileges to the user. It also utilizes several "tricks" to work. These are necessary for the utility to function properly.


Installation:
1) Remove current, previous, and/or other versions of this utility from your device.
2) Double-click "enable RunAsTI v2.reg" and proceed through the pop-up windows - select "Yes" and/or "OK" to all.
3) RunAsTI v2 is now installed!

Uninstallation:
1) Double-click "disable RunAsTI v2.reg" and proceed through the pop-up windows - select "Yes" and/or "OK" to all.
2) RunAsTI v2 is now uninstalled!

How to Use:
1) Right-click on a supported file/folder type.
2) Select "Run as trustedinstaller" and proceed through the pop-up windows - select "Yes" and/or "OK" to all.
3) Enjoy TI privileges! NOTE: If you close out, you will need to re-"Run as trustedinstaller" to gain those privileges again - RunAsTI v2 works for the current session only.
